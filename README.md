The aim of this project is to develop a responsive single-page web application that dynamically fetches and displays real-time weather data from a public API, such as the OpenWeatherMap API. The application allows users to input the name of a city and receive detailed weather information, including temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and an icon that visually represents the weather.

This project focuses on combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fully responsive and interactive interface. The webpage will be mobile-friendly and optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring accessibility and usability on devices ranging from smartphones to desktops.

The application features a search bar where users can input a city name. Upon submission, JavaScript uses the fetch API to send a request to OpenWeatherMap. The response data includes various weather attributes
